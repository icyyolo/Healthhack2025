There are various forms of intermittent fasting, some involving eating only on specific days, or fasting for set hours each day, with eating periods alternating between restricted and normal intake.\nWhile no single intermittent fasting method has been definitively proven to be the best, the principle of energy restriction during fasting periods can lead to weight loss over time if there is an overall energy deficit.\nFor individuals with diabetes interested in intermittent fasting, current guidance suggests that time-restricted eating or shortening the eating window is adaptable to most eating patterns and is generally safe for adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.", "type": "Document"}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"page_content": "However, medication use must be considered, especially for those on insulin or other anti-hyperglycemic medications, as fasting can lead to hypoglycemia, which could become severe if medication doses are not adjusted.
