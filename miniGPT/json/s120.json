For many individuals with diabetes, determining what to eat is the most challenging part of their treatment plan.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) states that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" eating pattern for individuals with diabetes. However, the ADA recognizes the critical role of nutrition therapy in overall diabetes management. It has historically recommended that each person with diabetes be actively engaged in self-management, education, and treatment planning with their healthcare provider. This includes collaboratively developing an individualized eating plan (1,2).\n\nAs a result, it is crucial for all members of the healthcare team to be knowledgeable about diabetes nutrition therapy and support its implementation.\n\nUpdated Position Statement\nThis position statement on nutrition therapy for individuals with diabetes replaces previous statements, the last of which was published in 2008 (3). The research reviewed primarily focuses on adults diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt does not address:\n\nNutrition therapy for the prevention of type 2 diabetes\nManagement of diabetes complications\nGestational diabetes mellitus\nA grading system, developed by the ADA and modeled after existing methods, was used to clarify and codify the evidence forming the basis of these recommendations (1) (Table 1).

(Evidence Rating: A)\nFor individuals with type 1 diabetes, participation in an intensive flexible insulin therapy education program using the carbohydrate counting meal planning approach can result in improved glycemic control. (Evidence Rating: A)\nFor individuals using fixed daily insulin doses, consistent carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount can result in improved glycemic control and reduce the risk for hypoglycemia. (Evidence Rating: B)\nA simple diabetes meal planning approach such as portion control or healthful food choices may be better suited to individuals with type 2 diabetes identified with health and numeracy literacy concerns. This may also be an effective meal planning strategy for older adults. (Evidence Rating: C)\nPeople with diabetes should receive DSME according to national standards and diabetes self-management support when their diabetes is diagnosed and as needed thereafter. (Evidence Rating: B)\nBecause diabetes nutrition therapy can result in cost savings and improved outcomes such as reduction in A1C, nutrition therapy should be adequately reimbursed by insurance and other payers. (Evidence Rating: B, A, E)\nEnergy Balance\nFor overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, reducing energy intake while maintaining a healthful eating pattern is recommended to promote weight loss. (Evidence Rating: A)\nModest weight loss may provide clinical benefits (improved glycemia, blood pressure, and/or lipids) in some individuals with diabetes, especially those early in the disease process. To achieve modest weight loss, intensive lifestyle interventions (counseling about nutrition therapy, physical activity, and behavior change) with ongoing support are recommended. (Evidence Rating: A)\nOptimal Mix of Macronutrients\nEvidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all people with diabetes; therefore, macronutrient distribution should be based on individualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. (Evidence Rating: B, E)\nEating Patterns\nA variety of eating patterns (combinations of different foods or food groups) are acceptable for the management of diabetes. Personal preferences (e.g., tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs and goals, economics) and metabolic goals should be considered when recommending one eating pattern over another. (Evidence Rating: E)\nCarbohydrates\nEvidence is inconclusive for an ideal amount of carbohydrate intake for people with diabetes. Therefore, collaborative goals should be developed with the individual with diabetes. (Evidence Rating: C)\nThe amount of carbohydrates and available insulin may be the most important factor influencing glycemic response after eating and should be considered when developing the eating plan. (Evidence Rating: A)\nMonitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (Evidence Rating: B)\nFor good health, carbohydrate intake from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and dairy products should be advised over intake from other carbohydrate sources, especially those that contain added fats, sugars, or sodium. (Evidence Rating: B)\nGlycemic Index and Glycemic Load\nSubstituting low-glycemic load foods for higher-glycemic load foods may modestly improve glycemic control. (Evidence Rating: C)\nDietary Fiber and Whole Grains\nPeople with diabetes should consume at least the amount of fiber and whole grains recommended for the general public. (Evidence Rating: C)\nSubstitution of Sucrose for Starch\nWhile substituting sucrose-containing foods for isocaloric amounts of other carbohydrates may have similar blood glucose effects, consumption should be minimized to avoid displacing nutrient-dense food choices. (Evidence Rating: A)\nFructose\nFructose consumed as \u201cfree fructose\u201d (i.e., naturally occurring in foods such as fruit) may result in better glycemic control compared with isocaloric intake of sucrose or starch, and free fructose is not likely to have detrimental effects on triglycerides as long as intake is not excessive (>12% energy).

(Evidence Rating: C)\nFor people with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (either micro- or macroalbuminuria), reducing the amount of dietary protein below usual intake is not recommended because it does not alter glycemic measures, cardiovascular risk measures, or the course of GFR decline. (Evidence Rating: A)\nIn individuals with type 2 diabetes, ingested protein appears to increase insulin response without increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, carbohydrate sources high in protein should not be used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia.

(Evidence Rating: B)\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids\nEvidence does not support recommending omega-3 (EPA and DHA) supplements for people with diabetes for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular events. (Evidence Rating: A)\nAs recommended for the general public, an increase in foods containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) (from fatty fish) and omega-3 linolenic acid (ALA) is recommended for individuals with diabetes because of their beneficial effects on lipoproteins, prevention of heart disease, and associations with positive health outcomes in observational studies. (Evidence Rating: B)\nThe recommendation for the general public to eat fish (particularly fatty fish) at least two times (two servings) per week is also appropriate for people with diabetes. (Evidence Rating: B)\nSaturated Fat, Dietary Cholesterol, and Trans Fat\nThe amount of dietary saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fat recommended for people with diabetes is the same as that recommended for the general population. (Evidence Rating: C)\nPlant Stanols and Sterols\nIndividuals with diabetes and dyslipidemia may be able to modestly reduce total and LDL cholesterol by consuming 1.6\u20133 g/day of plant stanols or sterols typically found in enriched foods. (Evidence Rating: C)\nMicronutrients and Herbal Supplements\nThere is no clear evidence of benefit from vitamin or mineral supplementation in people with diabetes who do not have underlying deficiencies. (Evidence Rating: C)\nRoutine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. (Evidence Rating: A)\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of micronutrients such as chromium, magnesium, and vitamin D to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes. (Evidence Rating: C)\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon or other herbs/supplements for the treatment of diabetes. (Evidence Rating: C)\nIt is recommended that individualized meal planning include optimization of food choices to meet recommended dietary allowance/dietary reference intake for all micronutrients. (Evidence Rating: E)\nAlcohol\nIf adults with diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). (Evidence Rating: E)\nAlcohol consumption may place people with diabetes at increased risk for delayed hypoglycemia, especially if taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Education and awareness regarding the recognition and management of delayed hypoglycemia is warranted. (Evidence Rating: C)\nSodium\nThe recommendation for the general population to reduce sodium to less than 2,300 mg/day is also appropriate for people with diabetes.

Further recommendations for individualization of goals can be found in the ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (1).\nMetabolic Control in Diabetes Management\nMetabolic control can be considered the cornerstone of diabetes management. Achieving A1C goals decreases the risk for microvascular complications (4,5) and may also be important for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction, particularly in newly diagnosed patients (6\u20138). In addition, achieving blood pressure and lipid goals can help reduce risk for CVD events (9,10). Carbohydrate intake has a direct effect on postprandial glucose levels in people with diabetes and is the primary macronutrient of concern in glycemic management (11).\nIn addition, an individual\u2019s food choices have a direct effect on energy balance and, therefore, on body weight, and food choices can also impact blood pressure and lipid levels.

(Evidence rating: E)\n\nThe common coexistence of hyperlipidemia and hypertension in people with diabetes requires monitoring of metabolic parameters (e.g., glucose, lipids, blood pressure, body weight, renal function) to ensure successful health outcomes (28). Nutrition therapy that includes the development of an eating pattern designed to lower glucose, blood pressure, and alter lipid profiles is important in the management of diabetes as well as lowering the risk of CVD, coronary heart disease, and stroke. \nSuccessful approaches should also include regular physical activity and behavioral interventions to help sustain improved lifestyles (11).\n\nFindings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and from systematic and Cochrane reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of nutrition therapy for improving glycemic control and various markers of cardiovascular and hypertension risk (13,14,29\u201346). In the general population, MNT provided by an RD to individuals with an abnormal lipid profile has been shown to reduce daily fat (5\u20138%), saturated fat (2\u20134%), and energy intake (232\u2013710 kcal/day), and lower triglycerides (11\u201331%), LDL cholesterol (7\u201322%), and total cholesterol (7\u201321%) levels (47).\n\nEffective nutrition therapy interventions may be a component of a comprehensive group diabetes education program or an individualized session (14,29\u201338,40\u201342,44,45). Reported A1C reductions are similar or greater than what would be expected with treatment with currently available pharmacologic treatments for diabetes. The documented decreases in A1C observed in these studies are type 1 diabetes: 20.3 to 21% (13,39,43,48) and type 2 diabetes: 20.5 to 22% (5,14,29\u201338,40\u201342,44,45,49).\n\nDue to the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, nutrition and physical activity interventions alone (i.e., without pharmacotherapy) are generally not adequately effective in maintaining persistent glycemic control over time for many individuals. However, after pharmacotherapy is initiated, nutrition therapy continues to be an important component of the overall treatment plan (2). For individuals with type 1 diabetes using multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, a primary focus for nutrition therapy should be on how to adjust insulin doses based on planned carbohydrate intake (13,39,43,50\u201353).\nFor individuals using fixed daily insulin doses, carbohydrate intake on a day-to-day basis should be consistent with respect to time and amount (54,55). Intensive insulin management education programs that include nutrition therapy have been shown to reduce A1C (13). Retrospective studies reveal durable A1C reductions with these types of programs (51,56) and significant improvements in quality of life (57) over time. Finally, nutritional approaches for reducing CVD risk, including optimizing serum lipids and blood pressure, can effectively reduce CVD events and mortality (1).\n\nEnergy Balance\nFor overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, reducing energy intake while maintaining a healthful eating pattern is recommended to promote weight loss. (Evidence rating: A)\nModest weight loss may provide clinical benefits (improved glycemia, blood pressure, and/or lipids) in some individuals with diabetes, especially those early in the disease process. To achieve modest weight loss, intensive lifestyle interventions (counseling about nutrition therapy, physical activity, and behavior change) with ongoing support are recommended. (Evidence rating: A)\n\nMore than three out of every four adults with diabetes are at least overweight (17), and nearly half of individuals with diabetes are obese (58). Because of the relationship between body weight (i.e., adiposity) and insulin resistance, weight loss has long been a recommended strategy for overweight or obese adults with diabetes (1). Prevention of weight gain is equally important. \nLong-term reduction of adiposity is difficult for most people to achieve, and even harder for individuals with diabetes to achieve given the impact of some medications used to improve glycemic control (e.g., insulin, insulin secretagogues, and thiazolidinediones) (59,60). A number of factors may be responsible for increasing adiposity in people with diabetes, including a reduction in glycosuria and thus retention of calories otherwise lost as an effect of therapeutic intervention, changes in food intake, or changes in.", "type": "Document"}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.0.0 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 4.1.6 by 1T3XT", "creator": "Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W Unicode", "creationdate": "2013-12-12T06:54:39+05:30", "title": "DC37s1s100 120..143", "moddate": "2025-02-22T16:07:46+00:00", "source": "rag/s120.pdf", "total_pages": 24, "page": 5, "page_label": "6"}, "page_content": "In interventional studies lasting 12 months or longer and targeting individuals with type 2 diabetes to reduce excess body weight (35,67\u201375), modest weight losses were achieved ranging from 1.9 to 8.4 kg. In the Look AHEAD trial, at study end (;10 years), the mean weight loss from baseline was 6% in the intervention group and 3.5% in the control group (76,77). Studies designed to reduce excess body weight have used a variety of energy-restricted eating patterns with various macronutrient intakes and occasionally included a physical activity component and ongoing follow-up support. Studies achieving the greatest weight losses, 6.2 kg and 8.4 kg, respectively, included the Mediterranean-style eating pattern (72) and a study testing a comprehensive weight loss program that involved diet (including meal replacements) and physical activity (76).\n\nIn the studies reviewed, improvements in A1C were noted to persist at 12 months in eight intervention groups within five studies (67,69,72,73,76); however, in one of the studies including data at 18 months, the A1C improvement was not maintained (69). The Mediterranean-style eating pattern reported the largest improvement of A1C at 1 year (21.2%) (72), and the Look AHEAD study intensive lifestyle intervention reported the next largest improvement (20.64%) (76). One of these studies included only individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes (72), and the other included predominantly individuals with diabetes early in the disease process (,30% were on insulin) (76). Significant improvements in A1C at 1 year were also reported in other studies using energy-restricted eating plans; these studies used meal replacements (67), or low-fat (72)/high-protein (73), or high-carbohydrate eating patterns (73). Not all weight loss interventions reviewed led to improvements in A1C at 1 year (35,68,70,71,74,75), although these studies tended to achieve less weight loss.\n\nAmong the studies reviewed, the most consistently reported significant changes of reducing excess body weight on cardiovascular risk factors were an increase in HDL cholesterol (67,72,73,75\u201377), a decrease in triglycerides (72,73,76\u201378), and a decrease in blood pressure (67,70,72,75\u201377). Despite some improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, the Look AHEAD trial failed to demonstrate reduction in CVD events among individuals randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention for sustained weight loss (77). Of note, however, those randomized to the intervention experienced statistically significant weight loss, requiring less medication for glycemic control and management of CVD risk factors, and experienced several additional health benefits (e.g., reduced sleep apnea, depression, and urinary incontinence and improved health-related quality of life) (79\u201382).\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs (ongoing, with frequent follow-up) are required to achieve significant reductions in excess body weight and improvements in A1C, blood pressure, and lipids (76,83). Weight loss appears to be most beneficial for individuals with diabetes early in the disease process (72,76,83). In the Look AHEAD study, participants with early-stage diabetes (shortest duration, not treated with insulin, good baseline glycemic control) received the most health benefits with a small percentage of individuals achieving partial or complete diabetes remission (84). It is unclear if the benefits result from the reduction in excess weight or the energy restriction or both.\n\nLong-term maintenance of weight, following weight reduction, is possible, but research suggests it requires an intensive program with long-term support. Many individuals do regain a portion of their initial weight loss (77,85). Factors contributing to the individual\u2019s inability to retain maximal weight loss include socioeconomic status, an unsupportive environment, and physiological changes (e.g., compensatory changes in circulating hormones that encourage weight regain after weight loss is achieved) (86).", "type": "Document"}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.0.0 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 4.1.6 by 1T3XT", "creator": "Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W Unicode", "creationdate": "2013-12-12T06:54:39+05:30", "title": "DC37s1s100 120..143", "moddate": "2025-02-22T16:07:46+00:00", "source": "rag/s120.pdf", "total_pages": 24, "page": 6, "page_label": "7"}, "page_content": "Optimal Mix of Macronutrients\n\nEvidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all people with diabetes B; therefore, macronutrient distribution should be based on individualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. (Evidence rating: E)\n\nAlthough numerous studies have attempted to identify the optimal mix of macronutrients for the meal plans of people with diabetes, a systematic review (88) found that there is no ideal mix that applies broadly and that macronutrient proportions should be individualized. On average, it has been observed that people with diabetes eat about 45% of their calories from carbohydrate, ;36\u201340% of calories from fat, and the remainder (;16\u201318%) from protein (89\u201391).\n\nRegardless of the macronutrient mix, total energy intake should be appropriate to weight management goals. Further, individualization of the macronutrient composition will depend on the metabolic status of the individual (e.g., lipid profile, renal function) and/or food preferences. A variety of eating patterns have been shown modestly effective in managing diabetes including Mediterranean-style, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style, plant-based (vegan or vegetarian), lower-fat, and lower-carbohydrate patterns (36,46,72,92,93).\n\nEating Patterns\n\nA variety of eating patterns (combinations of different foods or food groups) are acceptable for the management of diabetes. Personal preferences (e.g., tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs and goals, economics) and metabolic goals should be considered when recommending one eating pattern over another. (Evidence rating: E)\nEating patterns, also called dietary patterns, is a term used to describe combinations of different foods or food groups that characterize relationships between nutrition and health promotion and disease prevention (94). Individuals eat combinations of foods, not single nutrients, and thus it is important to study diet and disease relationships (95). Factors impacting eating patterns include, but are not limited to, food access/availability of healthful foods, tradition, cultural food systems, health beliefs, knowledge of foods that promote health and prevent disease, and economics/resources to buy health-promoting foods (95).\n\nEating patterns have also evolved over time to include patterns of food intake among specific populations to eating patterns prescribed to improve health. Patterns naturally occurring within populations based on food availability, culture, or tradition and those prescribed to prevent or manage health conditions are important to research. Eating patterns studied among individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were reviewed to evaluate their impact on diabetes nutrition goals. The following eating patterns (Table 3) were reviewed: Mediterranean, vegetarian, low fat, low carbohydrate, and DASH.\n\nThe Mediterranean-style eating pattern, mostly studied in the Mediterranean region, has been observed to improve cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., lipids, blood pressure, triglycerides) (11,72,88,100) in individuals with diabetes and lower combined end points for CVD events and stroke (83) when supplemented with mixed nuts (including walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) or olive oil. Individuals following an energy-restricted Mediterranean-style eating pattern also achieve improvements in glycemic control (88). Given that the studies are mostly in the Mediterranean region, further research is needed to determine if the study results can be generalized to other populations and if similar levels of adherence to the eating pattern can be achieved.\n\nThe low-fat eating pattern is one that has often been encouraged as a strategy to lose weight or to improve cardiovascular health within the U.S. In the Look AHEAD trial (77), an energy-reduced low-fat eating pattern was encouraged for weight loss, and individuals achieved moderate success (76). However, in a systematic review (88) and in four studies (70,71,75,103a) and in a meta-analysis (103b) published since the systematic review, lowering total fat intake did not consistently improve glycemic control or CVD risk factors. Benefit from a low-fat eating pattern appears to be more likely when energy intake is also reduced and weight loss occurs (76,77).\n\nFor a review of the studies focused on a low-carbohydrate eating pattern, see the CARBOHYDRATES section. Currently there is inadequate evidence in isocaloric comparison recommending a specific amount of carbohydrates for people with diabetes.\n\nIn people without diabetes, the DASH eating plan has been shown to help control blood pressure and lower risk for CVD and is frequently recommended as a healthful eating pattern for the general population (104\u2013106). Limited evidence exists on the effects of the DASH eating plan on health outcomes specifically in individuals with diabetes; however, one would expect similar results to other studies using the DASH eating plan. In one small study in people with type 2 diabetes, the DASH eating plan, which included a sodium restriction of 2,300 mg/day, improved A1C, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors (46).

These recommendations are not diabetes-specific; however, limited research exists in individuals with diabetes. Fatty acids are categorized as saturated or unsaturated (monounsaturated or polyunsaturated). Trans fatty acids may be unsaturated but have negative health effects. The type of fatty acids consumed is more important than total fat in the diet in terms of supporting metabolic goals and influencing the risk of CVD; thus, more attention should be given to the type of fat intake when individualizing goals. Individuals with diabetes should be encouraged to moderate their fat intakes to be consistent with their goals to lose or maintain weight.\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, a Mediterranean-style, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich eating pattern may benefit glycemic control and CVD risk factors and can be recommended as an effective alternative to a lower-fat, higher-carbohydrate eating pattern.

These include carbohydrate counting, healthful food choices, simplified meal plans (such as the Plate Method), individualized meal planning based on macronutrient percentages, exchange lists, the glycemic index, and eating patterns like Mediterranean, DASH, vegetarian/vegan, low carbohydrate, and low fat.

It's crucial to know which foods contain carbohydrates, such as starchy vegetables, whole grains, fruits, milk, and sugar.\nChoose nutrient-dense, high-fiber foods over processed foods high in added sodium, fats, and sugars. These foods provide vitamins and minerals with fewer calories.\nAvoid sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs).\nFor carbohydrate counting, it's generally unnecessary to subtract dietary fiber or sugar alcohols from total carbohydrates.\nSubstitute foods higher in unsaturated fats (liquid oils) for those high in trans or saturated fats.\nOpt for leaner protein sources and meat alternatives.\nVitamin and mineral supplements, herbal products, and cinnamon are not recommended for diabetes management due to insufficient evidence.\nModerate alcohol consumption (one drink/day for women and two for men) generally has minimal effects on blood glucose, but alcohol should be consumed with food to prevent hypoglycemia in individuals using insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nLimit sodium intake to 2,300 mg/day.\n\nCoordinating Food with Medication:\nFor individuals taking insulin secretagogues, consume moderate amounts of carbohydrates at meals and snacks, and always eat a source of carbohydrates with meals to avoid hypoglycemia. Avoid skipping meals and carry a source of carbohydrates during physical activity to reduce the risk of low blood glucose.\nFor those on biguanides (metformin), gradually titrate the medication to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Take the medication with food, and if side effects persist, follow up with a healthcare provider. Hypoglycemia may occur if taken with insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nFor \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, gradually titrate to minimize gastrointestinal side effects and take the medication at the start of meals. If hypoglycemia occurs, consume monosaccharides (like glucose tablets) since the drug prevents the digestion of polysaccharides.\nFor incretin mimetics (GLP-1), gradually titrate to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Premeal injections are necessary for daily or twice-daily GLP-1s, but once-weekly GLP-1s can be taken at any time of day. Follow up with a healthcare provider if side effects persist. Hypoglycemia may occur when combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nFor individuals with type 1 diabetes or insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes, learn to count carbohydrates or use other meal planning approaches to match mealtime insulin with carbohydrate intake. For multiple-daily injections or insulin pump users, take mealtime insulin before eating. If physical activity occurs within 1-2 hours of insulin injection, lower the dose to reduce hypoglycemia risk.\nFor individuals on a premixed insulin plan, insulin doses should be taken at consistent times, with meals at similar times each day. Do not skip meals, and carry quick-acting carbohydrates during physical activity to prevent hypoglycemia.\nFor those on a fixed insulin plan, eat similar amounts of carbohydrates daily to match the fixed insulin doses.", "type": "Document"}}, {"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"metadata": {"producer": "Acrobat Distiller 10.0.0 (Windows); modified using iTextSharp 4.1.6 by 1T3XT", "creator": "Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher 9.1.510/W Unicode", "creationdate": "2013-12-12T06:54:39+05:30", "title": "DC37s1s100 120..143", "moddate": "2025-02-22T16:07:46+00:00", "source": "rag/s120.pdf", "total_pages": 24, "page": 15, "page_label": "16"}, "page_content": "In order to be effective, nutrition therapy should be individualized for each person based on their specific health goals, as well as their personal and cultural preferences, health literacy, numeracy, access to healthful choices, and readiness, willingness, and ability to make changes.
