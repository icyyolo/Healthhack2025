        "Nutrition Therapy Recommendations for the management of adults with Diabetes\nA healthful eating pattern, regular physical activity, and often pharmacotherapy are key components of diabetes management. For many individuals with diabetes, determining what to eat is the most challenging part of their treatment plan.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) states that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" eating pattern for individuals with diabetes. However, the ADA recognizes the critical role of nutrition therapy in overall diabetes management. It has historically recommended that each person with diabetes be actively engaged in self-management, education, and treatment planning with their healthcare provider. This includes collaboratively developing an individualized eating plan (1,2).\n\nAs a result, it is crucial for all members of the healthcare team to be knowledgeable about diabetes nutrition therapy and support its implementation.",
        "As a result, it is crucial for all members of the healthcare team to be knowledgeable about diabetes nutrition therapy and support its implementation.\n\nUpdated Position Statement\nThis position statement on nutrition therapy for individuals with diabetes replaces previous statements, the last of which was published in 2008 (3). The research reviewed primarily focuses on adults diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt does not address:\n\nNutrition therapy for the prevention of type 2 diabetes\nManagement of diabetes complications\nGestational diabetes mellitus\nA grading system, developed by the ADA and modeled after existing methods, was used to clarify and codify the evidence forming the basis of these recommendations (1) (Table 1). Each recommendation is graded using the letters A, B, C, or E based on the level of evidence supporting it.\n\nA table linking recommendations to evidence can be reviewed at:\n\ud83d\udd17 http://professional.diabetes.org/nutrition",
        "A table linking recommendations to evidence can be reviewed at:\n\ud83d\udd17 http://professional.diabetes.org/nutrition\n\nMembers of the Nutrition Recommendations Writing Group Committee disclosed all potential financial conflicts of interest with industry, which were discussed at the onset of the position statement development process. The ADA funds the development of its position statements using general revenues and does not rely on industry support for this purpose.\n\nGoals of Nutrition Therapy for Adults with Diabetes\nThe primary goal is to promote and support healthful eating patterns, emphasizing a variety of nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes to improve overall health. Specifically, this aims to:\n\n\u2705 Achieve individualized health goals:\n\nA1C: <7%\nBlood Pressure: <140/80 mmHg\nLDL Cholesterol: <100 mg/dL\nTriglycerides: <150 mg/dL\nHDL Cholesterol:\nMen: >40 mg/dL\nWomen: >50 mg/dL\n\u2705 Achieve and maintain body weight goals\n\n\u2705 Delay or prevent complications of diabetes",
        "Table 1\u2014Nutrition Therapy Recommendations\nEffectiveness of Nutrition Therapy\nNutrition therapy is recommended for all people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes as an effective component of the overall treatment plan. (Evidence Rating: A)\nIndividuals who have diabetes should receive individualized MNT as needed to achieve treatment goals, preferably provided by an RD familiar with the components of diabetes MNT. (Evidence Rating: A)\nFor individuals with type 1 diabetes, participation in an intensive flexible insulin therapy education program using the carbohydrate counting meal planning approach can result in improved glycemic control. (Evidence Rating: A)\nFor individuals using fixed daily insulin doses, consistent carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount can result in improved glycemic control and reduce the risk for hypoglycemia. (Evidence Rating: B)",
        "A simple diabetes meal planning approach such as portion control or healthful food choices may be better suited to individuals with type 2 diabetes identified with health and numeracy literacy concerns. This may also be an effective meal planning strategy for older adults. (Evidence Rating: C)\nPeople with diabetes should receive DSME according to national standards and diabetes self-management support when their diabetes is diagnosed and as needed thereafter. (Evidence Rating: B)\nBecause diabetes nutrition therapy can result in cost savings and improved outcomes such as reduction in A1C, nutrition therapy should be adequately reimbursed by insurance and other payers. (Evidence Rating: B, A, E)\nEnergy Balance\nFor overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, reducing energy intake while maintaining a healthful eating pattern is recommended to promote weight loss. (Evidence Rating: A)",
        "Energy Balance\nFor overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, reducing energy intake while maintaining a healthful eating pattern is recommended to promote weight loss. (Evidence Rating: A)\nModest weight loss may provide clinical benefits (improved glycemia, blood pressure, and/or lipids) in some individuals with diabetes, especially those early in the disease process. To achieve modest weight loss, intensive lifestyle interventions (counseling about nutrition therapy, physical activity, and behavior change) with ongoing support are recommended. (Evidence Rating: A)\nOptimal Mix of Macronutrients\nEvidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all people with diabetes; therefore, macronutrient distribution should be based on individualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. (Evidence Rating: B, E)\nEating Patterns",
        "Eating Patterns\nA variety of eating patterns (combinations of different foods or food groups) are acceptable for the management of diabetes. Personal preferences (e.g., tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs and goals, economics) and metabolic goals should be considered when recommending one eating pattern over another. (Evidence Rating: E)\nCarbohydrates\nEvidence is inconclusive for an ideal amount of carbohydrate intake for people with diabetes. Therefore, collaborative goals should be developed with the individual with diabetes. (Evidence Rating: C)\nThe amount of carbohydrates and available insulin may be the most important factor influencing glycemic response after eating and should be considered when developing the eating plan. (Evidence Rating: A)\nMonitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (Evidence Rating: B)",
        "Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (Evidence Rating: B)\nFor good health, carbohydrate intake from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and dairy products should be advised over intake from other carbohydrate sources, especially those that contain added fats, sugars, or sodium. (Evidence Rating: B)\nGlycemic Index and Glycemic Load\nSubstituting low-glycemic load foods for higher-glycemic load foods may modestly improve glycemic control. (Evidence Rating: C)\nDietary Fiber and Whole Grains\nPeople with diabetes should consume at least the amount of fiber and whole grains recommended for the general public. (Evidence Rating: C)\nSubstitution of Sucrose for Starch",
        "People with diabetes should consume at least the amount of fiber and whole grains recommended for the general public. (Evidence Rating: C)\nSubstitution of Sucrose for Starch\nWhile substituting sucrose-containing foods for isocaloric amounts of other carbohydrates may have similar blood glucose effects, consumption should be minimized to avoid displacing nutrient-dense food choices. (Evidence Rating: A)\nFructose\nFructose consumed as \u201cfree fructose\u201d (i.e., naturally occurring in foods such as fruit) may result in better glycemic control compared with isocaloric intake of sucrose or starch, and free fructose is not likely to have detrimental effects on triglycerides as long as intake is not excessive (>12% energy). (Evidence Rating: B, C)\nPeople with diabetes should limit or avoid intake of SSBs (from any caloric sweetener including high fructose corn syrup and sucrose) to reduce the risk of weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk profile. (Evidence Rating: B)",
        "Table 1\u2014Continued\nNNSs and Hypocaloric Sweeteners\nUse of NNSs has the potential to reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake if substituted for caloric sweeteners without compensation by intake of additional calories from other food sources. (Evidence Rating: B)\nProtein\nFor people with diabetes and no evidence of diabetic kidney disease, evidence is inconclusive to recommend an ideal amount of protein intake for optimizing glycemic control or improving one or more CVD risk measures; therefore, goals should be individualized. (Evidence Rating: C)\nFor people with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (either micro- or macroalbuminuria), reducing the amount of dietary protein below usual intake is not recommended because it does not alter glycemic measures, cardiovascular risk measures, or the course of GFR decline. (Evidence Rating: A)",
        "In individuals with type 2 diabetes, ingested protein appears to increase insulin response without increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, carbohydrate sources high in protein should not be used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia. (Evidence Rating: B)\nTotal Fat\nEvidence is inconclusive for an ideal amount of total fat intake for people with diabetes; therefore, goals should be individualized. (Evidence Rating: C, B)\nFat quality appears to be far more important than quantity. (Evidence Rating: B)\nMUFAs/PUFAs\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, a Mediterranean-style, MUFA-rich eating pattern may benefit glycemic control and CVD risk factors and can therefore be recommended as an effective alternative to a lower-fat, higher-carbohydrate eating pattern. (Evidence Rating: B)\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids\nEvidence does not support recommending omega-3 (EPA and DHA) supplements for people with diabetes for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular events. (Evidence Rating: A)",
        "Omega-3 Fatty Acids\nEvidence does not support recommending omega-3 (EPA and DHA) supplements for people with diabetes for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular events. (Evidence Rating: A)\nAs recommended for the general public, an increase in foods containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) (from fatty fish) and omega-3 linolenic acid (ALA) is recommended for individuals with diabetes because of their beneficial effects on lipoproteins, prevention of heart disease, and associations with positive health outcomes in observational studies. (Evidence Rating: B)\nThe recommendation for the general public to eat fish (particularly fatty fish) at least two times (two servings) per week is also appropriate for people with diabetes. (Evidence Rating: B)\nSaturated Fat, Dietary Cholesterol, and Trans Fat",
        "Saturated Fat, Dietary Cholesterol, and Trans Fat\nThe amount of dietary saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fat recommended for people with diabetes is the same as that recommended for the general population. (Evidence Rating: C)\nPlant Stanols and Sterols\nIndividuals with diabetes and dyslipidemia may be able to modestly reduce total and LDL cholesterol by consuming 1.6\u20133 g/day of plant stanols or sterols typically found in enriched foods. (Evidence Rating: C)\nMicronutrients and Herbal Supplements\nThere is no clear evidence of benefit from vitamin or mineral supplementation in people with diabetes who do not have underlying deficiencies. (Evidence Rating: C)\nRoutine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. (Evidence Rating: A)",
        "Routine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. (Evidence Rating: A)\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of micronutrients such as chromium, magnesium, and vitamin D to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes. (Evidence Rating: C)\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon or other herbs/supplements for the treatment of diabetes. (Evidence Rating: C)\nIt is recommended that individualized meal planning include optimization of food choices to meet recommended dietary allowance/dietary reference intake for all micronutrients. (Evidence Rating: E)\nAlcohol\nIf adults with diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). (Evidence Rating: E)",
        "Alcohol consumption may place people with diabetes at increased risk for delayed hypoglycemia, especially if taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Education and awareness regarding the recognition and management of delayed hypoglycemia is warranted.

Further recommendations for individualization of goals can be found in the ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (1).\nMetabolic Control in Diabetes Management\nMetabolic control can be considered the cornerstone of diabetes management. Achieving A1C goals decreases the risk for microvascular complications (4,5) and may also be important for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction, particularly in newly diagnosed patients (6\u20138). In addition, achieving blood pressure and lipid goals can help reduce risk for CVD events (9,10). Carbohydrate intake has a direct effect on postprandial glucose levels in people with diabetes and is the primary macronutrient of concern in glycemic management (11).",

        "The common coexistence of hyperlipidemia and hypertension in people with diabetes requires monitoring of metabolic parameters (e.g., glucose, lipids, blood pressure, body weight, renal function) to ensure successful health outcomes (28). Nutrition therapy that includes the development of an eating pattern designed to lower glucose, blood pressure, and alter lipid profiles is important in the management of diabetes as well as lowering the risk of CVD, coronary heart disease, and stroke. \nSuccessful approaches should also include regular physical activity and behavioral interventions to help sustain improved lifestyles (11).",
        "Findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and from systematic and Cochrane reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of nutrition therapy for improving glycemic control and various markers of cardiovascular and hypertension risk (13,14,29\u201346). In the general population, MNT provided by an RD to individuals with an abnormal lipid profile has been shown to reduce daily fat (5\u20138%), saturated fat (2\u20134%), and energy intake (232\u2013710 kcal/day), and lower triglycerides (11\u201331%), LDL cholesterol (7\u201322%), and total cholesterol (7\u201321%) levels (47).",

Reported A1C reductions are similar or greater than what would be expected with treatment with currently available pharmacologic treatments for diabetes. The documented decreases in A1C observed in these studies are type 1 diabetes: 20.3 to 21% (13,39,43,48) and type 2 diabetes: 20.5 to 22% (5,14,29\u201338,40\u201342,44,45,49).",
        "Due to the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, nutrition and physical activity interventions alone (i.e., without pharmacotherapy) are generally not adequately effective in maintaining persistent glycemic control over time for many individuals. However, after pharmacotherapy is initiated, nutrition therapy continues to be an important component of the overall treatment plan (2). For individuals with type 1 diabetes using multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, a primary focus for nutrition therapy should be on how to adjust insulin doses based on planned carbohydrate intake (13,39,43,50\u201353).",
        "For individuals using fixed daily insulin doses, carbohydrate intake on a day-to-day basis should be consistent with respect to time and amount (54,55). Intensive insulin management education programs that include nutrition therapy have been shown to reduce A1C (13). Retrospective studies reveal durable A1C reductions with these types of programs (51,56) and significant improvements in quality of life (57) over time.

        "Energy Balance\nFor overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes, reducing energy intake while maintaining a healthful eating pattern is recommended to promote weight loss. (Evidence rating: A)\nModest weight loss may provide clinical benefits (improved glycemia, blood pressure, and/or lipids) in some individuals with diabetes, especially those early in the disease process. To achieve modest weight loss, intensive lifestyle interventions (counseling about nutrition therapy, physical activity, and behavior change) with ongoing support are recommended. (Evidence rating: A)",
        "More than three out of every four adults with diabetes are at least overweight (17), and nearly half of individuals with diabetes are obese (58). Because of the relationship between body weight (i.e., adiposity) and insulin resistance, weight loss has long been a recommended strategy for overweight or obese adults with diabetes (1). Prevention of weight gain is equally important. \nLong-term reduction of adiposity is difficult for most people to achieve, and even harder for individuals with diabetes to achieve given the impact of some medications used to improve glycemic control (e.g., insulin, insulin secretagogues, and thiazolidinediones) (59,60). A number of factors may be responsible for increasing adiposity in people with diabetes, including a reduction in glycosuria and thus retention of calories otherwise lost as an effect of therapeutic intervention, changes in food intake, or changes in.",
        "In interventional studies lasting 12 months or longer and targeting individuals with type 2 diabetes to reduce excess body weight (35,67\u201375), modest weight losses were achieved ranging from 1.9 to 8.4 kg. In the Look AHEAD trial, at study end (;10 years), the mean weight loss from baseline was 6% in the intervention group and 3.5% in the control group (76,77). Studies designed to reduce excess body weight have used a variety of energy-restricted eating patterns with various macronutrient intakes and occasionally included a physical activity component and ongoing follow-up support. Studies achieving the greatest weight losses, 6.2 kg and 8.4 kg, respectively, included the Mediterranean-style eating pattern (72) and a study testing a comprehensive weight loss program that involved diet (including meal replacements) and physical activity (76).",
        "In the studies reviewed, improvements in A1C were noted to persist at 12 months in eight intervention groups within five studies (67,69,72,73,76); however, in one of the studies including data at 18 months, the A1C improvement was not maintained (69). The Mediterranean-style eating pattern reported the largest improvement of A1C at 1 year (21.2%) (72), and the Look AHEAD study intensive lifestyle intervention reported the next largest improvement (20.64%) (76). One of these studies included only individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes (72), and the other included predominantly individuals with diabetes early in the disease process (,30% were on insulin) (76). Significant improvements in A1C at 1 year were also reported in other studies using energy-restricted eating plans; these studies used meal replacements (67), or low-fat (72)/high-protein (73), or high-carbohydrate eating patterns (73). Not all weight loss interventions reviewed led to improvements in A1C at 1 year",
        "studies used meal replacements (67), or low-fat (72)/high-protein (73), or high-carbohydrate eating patterns (73). Not all weight loss interventions reviewed led to improvements in A1C at 1 year (35,68,70,71,74,75), although these studies tended to achieve less weight loss.",
        "Among the studies reviewed, the most consistently reported significant changes of reducing excess body weight on cardiovascular risk factors were an increase in HDL cholesterol (67,72,73,75\u201377), a decrease in triglycerides (72,73,76\u201378), and a decrease in blood pressure (67,70,72,75\u201377). Despite some improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, the Look AHEAD trial failed to demonstrate reduction in CVD events among individuals randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention for sustained weight loss (77). Of note, however, those randomized to the intervention experienced statistically significant weight loss, requiring less medication for glycemic control and management of CVD risk factors, and experienced several additional health benefits (e.g., reduced sleep apnea, depression, and urinary incontinence and improved health-related quality of life) (79\u201382).",
        "Intensive lifestyle programs (ongoing, with frequent follow-up) are required to achieve significant reductions in excess body weight and improvements in A1C, blood pressure, and lipids (76,83). Weight loss appears to be most beneficial for individuals with diabetes early in the disease process (72,76,83). In the Look AHEAD study, participants with early-stage diabetes (shortest duration, not treated with insulin, good baseline glycemic control) received the most health benefits with a small percentage of individuals achieving partial or complete diabetes remission (84). It is unclear if the benefits result from the reduction in excess weight or the energy restriction or both.",
        "Long-term maintenance of weight, following weight reduction, is possible, but research suggests it requires an intensive program with long-term support. Many individuals do regain a portion of their initial weight loss (77,85). Factors contributing to the individual\u2019s inability to retain maximal weight loss include socioeconomic status, an unsupportive environment, and physiological changes (e.g., compensatory changes in circulating hormones that encourage weight regain after weight loss is achieved) (86).",
        "Optimal Mix of Macronutrients\n\nEvidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all people with diabetes B; therefore, macronutrient distribution should be based on individualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. (Evidence rating: E)\n\nAlthough numerous studies have attempted to identify the optimal mix of macronutrients for the meal plans of people with diabetes, a systematic review (88) found that there is no ideal mix that applies broadly and that macronutrient proportions should be individualized. On average, it has been observed that people with diabetes eat about 45% of their calories from carbohydrate, ;36\u201340% of calories from fat, and the remainder (;16\u201318%) from protein (89\u201391).",
        "Regardless of the macronutrient mix, total energy intake should be appropriate to weight management goals. Further, individualization of the macronutrient composition will depend on the metabolic status of the individual (e.g., lipid profile, renal function) and/or food preferences. A variety of eating patterns have been shown modestly effective in managing diabetes including Mediterranean-style, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style, plant-based (vegan or vegetarian), lower-fat, and lower-carbohydrate patterns (36,46,72,92,93).\n\nEating Patterns",
        "Eating Patterns\n\nA variety of eating patterns (combinations of different foods or food groups) are acceptable for the management of diabetes. Personal preferences (e.g., tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs and goals, economics) and metabolic goals should be considered when recommending one eating pattern over another. (Evidence rating: E)\nEating patterns, also called dietary patterns, is a term used to describe combinations of different foods or food groups that characterize relationships between nutrition and health promotion and disease prevention (94). Individuals eat combinations of foods, not single nutrients, and thus it is important to study diet and disease relationships (95). Factors impacting eating patterns include, but are not limited to, food access/availability of healthful foods, tradition, cultural food systems, health beliefs, knowledge of foods that promote health and prevent disease, and economics/resources to buy health-promoting foods (95).",
        "Eating patterns have also evolved over time to include patterns of food intake among specific populations to eating patterns prescribed to improve health. Patterns naturally occurring within populations based on food availability, culture, or tradition and those prescribed to prevent or manage health conditions are important to research. Eating patterns studied among individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were reviewed to evaluate their impact on diabetes nutrition goals. The following eating patterns (Table 3) were reviewed: Mediterranean, vegetarian, low fat, low carbohydrate, and DASH.",
        "The Mediterranean-style eating pattern, mostly studied in the Mediterranean region, has been observed to improve cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., lipids, blood pressure, triglycerides) (11,72,88,100) in individuals with diabetes and lower combined end points for CVD events and stroke (83) when supplemented with mixed nuts (including walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) or olive oil. Individuals following an energy-restricted Mediterranean-style eating pattern also achieve improvements in glycemic control (88). Given that the studies are mostly in the Mediterranean region, further research is needed to determine if the study results can be generalized to other populations and if similar levels of adherence to the eating pattern can be achieved.",
        "The low-fat eating pattern is one that has often been encouraged as a strategy to lose weight or to improve cardiovascular health within the U.S. In the Look AHEAD trial (77), an energy-reduced low-fat eating pattern was encouraged for weight loss, and individuals achieved moderate success (76). However, in a systematic review (88) and in four studies (70,71,75,103a) and in a meta-analysis (103b) published since the systematic review, lowering total fat intake did not consistently improve glycemic control or CVD risk factors. Benefit from a low-fat eating pattern appears to be more likely when energy intake is also reduced and weight loss occurs (76,77).\n\nFor a review of the studies focused on a low-carbohydrate eating pattern, see the CARBOHYDRATES section. Currently there is inadequate evidence in isocaloric comparison recommending a specific amount of carbohydrates for people with diabetes.",
        "In people without diabetes, the DASH eating plan has been shown to help control blood pressure and lower risk for CVD and is frequently recommended as a healthful eating pattern for the general population (104\u2013106). Limited evidence exists on the effects of the DASH eating plan on health outcomes specifically in individuals with diabetes; however, one would expect similar results to other studies using the DASH eating plan. In one small study in people with type 2 diabetes, the DASH eating plan, which included a sodium restriction of 2,300 mg/day, improved A1C, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors (46). The blood pressure benefits are thought to be due to the total eating pattern, including the reduction in sodium and other foods and nutrients that have been shown to influence blood pressure (99,105).",
        "The amount of carbohydrates and available insulin may be the most important factor influencing glycemic response after eating and should be considered when developing the eating plan. (Evidence rating: A)\nMonitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control.

        "Substitution of sucrose-containing foods for isocaloric amounts of other carbohydrates may have similar blood glucose effects, but consumption should be minimized to avoid displacing nutrient-dense food choices. Sucrose is a disaccharide made of glucose and fructose, commonly known as table sugar or white sugar, and is found naturally in sugar cane and sugar beets. Research demonstrates that substituting sucrose for starch for up to 35% of calories may not affect glycemia or lipid levels. However, since foods high in sucrose are generally high in calories, the substitution should be made cautiously within the context of an overall healthful eating pattern to avoid increasing caloric intake. \nAdditionally, as with all people, selecting foods containing sucrose or starch should prioritize more nutrient-dense foods for a healthful eating pattern. (Evidence rating: A)",
        "Fructose consumed as \u201cfree fructose\u201d (i.e., naturally occurring in foods such as fruit) may result in better glycemic control compared to isocaloric intake of sucrose or starch (B), and free fructose is not likely to have detrimental effects on triglycerides as long as intake is not excessive (greater than 12% of energy) (C). People with diabetes should limit or avoid the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), including those containing any caloric sweetener such as high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose, to reduce the risk for weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk profile (Evidence rating: B).",
        "It appears that free fructose (naturally occurring in foods such as fruit) consumption is not more harmful than other forms of sugar unless intake exceeds approximately 12% of total caloric intake. Many foods marketed to people with diabetes may contain large amounts of fructose (such as agave nectar); these foods should not be consumed in large amounts to avoid excessive caloric intake and to prevent excessive fructose consumption.\nLarge quantities of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) should be avoided to reduce the risk for weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors. Evidence suggests that consuming high levels of fructose-containing beverages may have particularly adverse effects on the selective deposition of ectopic and visceral fat, lipid metabolism, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and de novo lipogenesis, compared with glucose-sweetened beverages. In terms of specific effects of fructose, concern has been raised regarding elevations in serum triglycerides.",
        "Protein\nFor people with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (either micro- or macroalbuminuria), reducing the amount of dietary protein below the usual intake is not recommended because it does not alter glycemic measures, cardiovascular risk measures, or the course of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline.

These recommendations are not diabetes-specific; however, limited research exists in individuals with diabetes. Fatty acids are categorized as saturated or unsaturated (monounsaturated or polyunsaturated). Trans fatty acids may be unsaturated but have negative health effects. The type of fatty acids consumed is more important than total fat in the diet in terms of supporting metabolic goals and influencing the risk of CVD; thus, more attention should be given to the type of fat intake when individualizing goals. Individuals with diabetes should be encouraged to moderate their fat intakes to be consistent with their goals to lose or maintain weight.",

        "Strategies for All People with Diabetes:\nPortion control is essential for weight loss and maintenance.\nCarbohydrate-containing foods and endogenous insulin production are the primary determinants of postmeal blood glucose. It's crucial to know which foods contain carbohydrates, such as starchy vegetables, whole grains, fruits, milk, and sugar.\nChoose nutrient-dense, high-fiber foods over processed foods high in added sodium, fats, and sugars. These foods provide vitamins and minerals with fewer calories.\nAvoid sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs).\nFor carbohydrate counting, it's generally unnecessary to subtract dietary fiber or sugar alcohols from total carbohydrates.\nSubstitute foods higher in unsaturated fats (liquid oils) for those high in trans or saturated fats.\nOpt for leaner protein sources and meat alternatives.\nVitamin and mineral supplements, herbal products, and cinnamon are not recommended for diabetes management due to insufficient evidence.",
        "Opt for leaner protein sources and meat alternatives.\nVitamin and mineral supplements, herbal products, and cinnamon are not recommended for diabetes management due to insufficient evidence.\nModerate alcohol consumption (one drink/day for women and two for men) generally has minimal effects on blood glucose, but alcohol should be consumed with food to prevent hypoglycemia in individuals using insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nLimit sodium intake to 2,300 mg/day.",
        "Coordinating Food with Medication:\nFor individuals taking insulin secretagogues, consume moderate amounts of carbohydrates at meals and snacks, and always eat a source of carbohydrates with meals to avoid hypoglycemia. Avoid skipping meals and carry a source of carbohydrates during physical activity to reduce the risk of low blood glucose.\nFor those on biguanides (metformin), gradually titrate the medication to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Take the medication with food, and if side effects persist, follow up with a healthcare provider. Hypoglycemia may occur if taken with insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nFor \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, gradually titrate to minimize gastrointestinal side effects and take the medication at the start of meals. If hypoglycemia occurs, consume monosaccharides (like glucose tablets) since the drug prevents the digestion of polysaccharides.",
        "For incretin mimetics (GLP-1), gradually titrate to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Premeal injections are necessary for daily or twice-daily GLP-1s, but once-weekly GLP-1s can be taken at any time of day. Follow up with a healthcare provider if side effects persist. Hypoglycemia may occur when combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nFor individuals with type 1 diabetes or insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes, learn to count carbohydrates or use other meal planning approaches to match mealtime insulin with carbohydrate intake. For multiple-daily injections or insulin pump users, take mealtime insulin before eating. If physical activity occurs within 1-2 hours of insulin injection, lower the dose to reduce hypoglycemia risk.\nFor individuals on a premixed insulin plan, insulin doses should be taken at consistent times, with meals at similar times each day. Do not skip meals, and carry quick-acting carbohydrates during physical activity to prevent hypoglycemia.",

While some fiber supplements may be beneficial, most have not been studied as extensively as inherent dietary fiber in whole foods.\nThe best approach is to prioritize fiber-rich whole foods, such as: Minimally processed whole grains, Vegetables, Whole fruits and Legumes\nMinimizing processing is important because it helps retain the natural benefits of fiber while avoiding added saturated fats, sodium, and sugars that are often introduced during food processing.",

Common whole grains include whole wheat, whole oats, brown rice, barley, and quinoa.\nWhen purchasing whole grain foods, check the label to ensure that the whole grain is the first ingredient listed and that the energy from sugars is less than 10%.\nConsume fruit, but choose whole fruit over dried, juiced, or further processed fruit.\nLegumes are an excellent and affordable source of fiber and protein. Consider replacing ground meat in meals, like casseroles, with lentils or legumes.\nStrive to include a variety of vegetables in your meals each day, and avoid deep-fried and heavily salted options.",
        "Evidence in inconclusive for an ideal amount of total fat intake for people with diabetes, therefore, goals should be individualized.\nPeople with diabetes should aim to replace saturated and trans fats in their diet with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats to reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with high saturated and trans-fat intake. Recent meta-analyses have shown that decreasing saturated and trans-fatty acids, which are the primary dietary fats linked to elevated LDL cholesterol, lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.",
        "The World Health Organization and the American College of Cardiology recommend limiting dietary saturated and trans-fat intake. The Institute of Medicine and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggest that 20% to 35% of total energy should come from fat for healthy individuals. Recommendations to reduce total fat intake are largely based on the high energy density of fats compared to protein or carbohydrates and the risks associated with higher saturated fat consumption. Current American Diabetes Association guidelines emphasize fat quality and its sources rather than quantity.\nPeople with diabetes should consider an eating plan that incorporates elements of a Mediterranean-style diet, which is rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, as well as long-chain fatty acids found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds. This approach can help reduce cardiovascular disease risk and improve glucose metabolism.",
        "The American Heart Association has developed the Fat Facts initiative to educate individuals on healthy versus unhealthy fats. A key priority of this campaign is to encourage the replacement of trans-fat-rich partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, animal fats, and tropical oils with healthier options, such as oils and foods high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.",
        "Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA)\n\nMonounsaturated fats (MUFA) are found in foods such as avocado, some fish, nuts, and nut butters. They are also present in vegetable oils like olive, peanut, avocado, and canola oil. Several large prospective observational studies have shown that diets rich in MUFA or polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) and lower in saturated fat are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nMeta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing diets higher in MUFA versus carbohydrates or PUFA suggest that MUFA-rich diets can improve metabolic parameters and reduce cardiovascular disease risk in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n\nPolyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)",
        "Polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) are found in foods like walnuts, sunflower seeds, and some fish, such as salmon, mackerel, herring, and trout. PUFAs are also present in vegetable oils such as corn oil, safflower oil, and soybean oil. Both MUFA and PUFA are typically liquid at room temperature. A meta-analysis of feeding trials has consistently shown positive effects when other macronutrients, such as saturated fats, are replaced with PUFA, improving glycemia, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion capacity.\nData from prospective observational studies also suggests that replacing saturated and trans fats with PUFAs reduces all-cause mortality and coronary heart disease, with a smaller body of evidence in individuals with diabetes indicating similar improvements in cardiovascular disease risk.",
        "Regular fish consumption may help reduce triglycerides by replacing other foods that are higher in saturated and trans fats, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products. It is recommended to prepare fish without frying or adding cream-based sauces. Fish that are high in EPA and DHA include salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, sardines, herring, and lake trout.Nuts and seeds high in ALA include walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, and soybeans.",
        "Saturated Fats\nProcessed and fast foods also contain high amounts of saturated fats. Some vegetable oils, such as palm, palm kernel, and coconut oils, can also be high in saturated fats. In general, saturated fats are discouraged because they increase LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels. Diets high in saturated fats have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\nAs saturated fats are reduced in the diet, they should be replaced with unsaturated fats and high-fiber carbohydrates, not with trans fats or refined carbohydrates.",
        "Trans Fats\n\nTrans fats appear at least as harmful to health as saturated fats. Based on observations from both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies, the World Health Organization currently recommends that the total intake of trans fats be less than 1% of total energy intake.\nThe main sources of trans fats in the food supply today are highly processed foods such as cakes, cookies, potato chips, and animal products. They can also be produced in the home when frying foods in fat at high temperatures. While most trans fats in the diet are created during food manufacturing, smaller amounts of trans fats are also found in ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep.\n\nCholesterol",
        "Cholesterol\n\nThe body produces enough cholesterol for physiological functions, so it is not necessary to obtain it from foods. Older dietary guidelines recommended avoiding or limiting foods high in cholesterol, based on the idea that their intake would raise circulating cholesterol levels.\nSaturated fat intake has a stronger influence on human cholesterol levels. As a result, current recommendations focus on reducing saturated fat as the priority.\nIndividuals with diabetes and dyslipidemia may be able to reduce total and LDL cholesterol by consuming at least 2 grams per day of plant stanols or sterols found in enriched foods.\n\nPractical Tips on Fat Intake:",
        "Practical Tips on Fat Intake:\n\nFat intake should come primarily from good sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats such as nuts, seeds, avocados, fish, and oils like olive, canola, soybean, sunflower, and corn.\nLimit saturated fat intake by cutting back on processed and fast foods, red meat, and full-fat dairy products. Replace red meat with beans, nuts, skinless poultry, and fish when possible, and switch from whole milk and other full-fat dairy foods to lower-fat versions.\nUse liquid vegetable oils rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats in place of butter or margarine for cooking and at the table.\nKeep trans fat intake as low as possible by checking food labels and limiting fried foods.",
        "Protein",
        "Protein intake goals should be individualized based on an individual's current eating patterns. The ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2024 state that there is no evidence that adjusting the daily level of protein intake (typically 1-1.5 g/kg body weight/day or 10-20% total energy) will improve health in individuals without diabetic kidney disease. Research is inconclusive regarding the ideal amount of dietary protein to optimize glycemic control or cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.\nSome research has found successful management of weight and type 2 diabetes with meal plans including slightly higher levels of protein (23-32% total energy) for periods up to one year for those without kidney disease. Individuals with diabetic kidney disease (with albuminuria and/or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate) should aim to maintain dietary protein at the recommended daily allowance of no more than 0.8g/kg desirable body weight/day (or 10-15% total energy).",
        "The National Kidney Foundation recommends 0.8 g protein/kg desirable body weight for people with diabetes and stages 1-4 chronic kidney disease as a means of reducing albuminuria and stabilizing kidney function. Reducing dietary protein below 10% total energy is not recommended, as it may lead to protein inadequacy.\nThe ADA recommends that in individuals with type 2 diabetes, ingested protein can increase insulin response without increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, carbohydrate sources high in protein should not be used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia.",
        "Further research is required to identify whether the dietary source of protein (animal or plant) is important for health and diabetes. There is emerging evidence suggesting that plant-sourced proteins may be superior for health, although it is not yet known if this is due to the amino acid compositions of the proteins or unadjusted effects from the accompanying nutrients, such as saturated fats in meat sources and dietary fiber in plant sources of protein.\nReplacing red meat with plant-based protein sources (such as beans and legumes) appears to produce both health and environmental co-benefits, as well as being cheaper.",
        "Practical Tips For Protein Intake:",
        "Ideal plant protein sources include legumes, lentils, tofu, and tempeh (1/2 cup or 2 oz protein). Plant-based meat alternatives (e.g., Quorn) may also be used, but be cautious of meat alternatives with high sodium and saturated fat content.\nNuts and seeds are another plant-based protein source to encourage, such as almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, filberts, Brazil nuts, macadamias, peanuts, pecans, walnuts, or sunflower, pumpkin seeds, or linseed. Nut butters are also a plant-based protein source, but watch for added sodium and sugars.\nGood sources of lean animal protein include skinless poultry, lower-fat cuts of beef or pork, fish or eggs, and reduced-fat dairy products (e.g., low-fat or skim milk/yogurt and cheese).\nProtein sources should be a supplement to vegetables, fruits, and whole grains for most meals, rather than the main component of the meal.",
        "Protein sources should be a supplement to vegetables, fruits, and whole grains for most meals, rather than the main component of the meal.\nThere is no clear evidence that dietary supplementation with vitamins (such as Vitamin D), minerals (such as chromium), herbs, or spices (such as cinnamon or aloe vera) can improve outcomes in diabetes management where there are no underlying deficiencies. There is insufficient evidence for dietary supplements to be recommended for the purposes of improving glycemic control.",
        "People with diabetes should focus on meeting their vitamin and mineral needs through natural food sources by consuming a balanced diet. Specific populations, such as older adults, pregnant or lactating women, strict vegetarians or vegans, and individuals on very low energy diets, may benefit from a multivitamin or mineral supplement. However, excessive doses of certain vitamin or mineral supplements when there is no deficiency have been shown to provide no benefit and may even be harmful.",
        "Vitamins\n\nSince type 2 diabetes is a state of increased oxidative stress, there has been interest in recommending large doses of antioxidant vitamins. However, current studies show no benefit of carotene, Vitamin E, or Vitamin C in improving glycemic control or treating complications. Routinely supplementing the diet with antioxidant supplements is not recommended due to the lack of evidence showing benefit in large, placebo-controlled clinical trials, as well as concerns regarding potential long-term safety.\nAdditionally, there is not enough evidence to recommend routine Vitamin D supplementation unless a deficiency is present.",
        "Sodium",
        "As for the general population, those with diabetes should limit sodium consumption to 2,300 mg/day. Active steps to reduce current sodium intakes are necessary, as current intakes in the United States are around 3,400 mg/day, nearly 50% more than the recommended limit.\nThe majority of sodium consumed is from processed foods. For those with diabetes and hypertension, additional lifestyle modification beyond reducing sodium intake can be helpful, including: loss of excess body weight; increasing consumption of vegetables and fruit (8-10 servings/day), and low-fat dairy products (2-3 servings/day); avoiding excessive alcohol consumption (no more than 2 servings/day in men and no more than 1 serving/day in women); and increasing physical activity levels.",
        "These nonpharmacological strategies may also positively affect glycemia and lipid control. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which is high in vegetables and fruit, low-fat dairy, and low in saturated and total fat, has been shown in large, randomized, controlled trials to significantly reduce blood pressure.",
        "Magnesium\nThere is some evidence from observational data that higher dietary intake of magnesium may help prevent type 2 diabetes in both middle-aged men and women at higher risk for developing the disease.\nAdditional long-term studies are needed to determine the best way to assess magnesium status and how magnesium deficiency impacts diabetes management; however, dietary sources of magnesium, including nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables, can be encouraged as part of a healthy dietary pattern.\n\nRoutine supplementation of chromium is not recommended for treating diabetes or obesity.",
        "The ADA also states that the use of any herbal supplements, which are not regulated and vary in content, may provide more risk than benefit, in that herbs may interact with other medications.\nAt present there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for people with diabetes to take a probiotic for glycemic control.\n\nAlcohol\nAlcohol consumption may place people with diabetes at increased risk for hypoglycemia, especially if taking insulin or insulin secretagogues.\nRisks of excessive alcohol intake indude hypoglycemia (particularly for those using insulin or insulin secretagogue therapies), weight gain, and hyperglycemia (for those consuming excessive amounts). \nTo decrease the risk of alcohol induced hypoglycernia, it is best to have the alcohol with food. Consuming alcohol in a fasting state may contribute to hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes.",
        "Insulin\nPeople taking insulin should be counseled on the importance of balancing food and beverage intake with timing and dosing of insulin.\nThis is especially important for individuals with varied or hectic schedules such as shift workers, people that travel frequently, or anyone who has a schedule in which timing of meals and access to food is irregular\nHealth care providers should provide individualized guidelines for a target blood glucose range, considering safety and health.\nFor motivated people, teaching an insulin to CHO ratio, and blood glucose correction factor may assist them with achieving blood glucose targets and achieving better glycemic control.",
        "Carbohydrate counting\nCarbohydrate counting is a tool that can be taught to the motivated, so that they can more easily estimate the amount (grams) of CHO in a particular food and adapt their insulin therapy accordingly. Furthermore, setting a target CHO intake for each meal allows those with diabetes to better match their CHO intake to the appropriate mealtime insulin dose. Potential advantages of CHO counting include improved glucose control, flexibility in food choices, a better understanding of how much insulin to take, and simplification of meal planning.",
        "Carbohydrate (CHO) intake affects acute blood glucose levels. Monitoring carbohydrate, whether by carbohydrate counting, using the exchange method, or experienced-based estimation, remains an important strategy used in timing of medication administration and improving glycemic control. CHO counting methodology is based on the concept that each serving of CHO equals approximately 15 grams of CHO.\nGenerally, blood glucose response to digestible carbohydrate is similar; however, carbohydrate sources naturally high in fiber, including whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and whole fruits, should be encouraged over highly processed foods, fruit juices, and fatty foods.",
        "SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THOSE WITH INTENSIVE INSULIN REGIMENS",
        "The following guidelines are the starting point for the nutritional component of intensified insulin management regimens for those not on closed loop systems: (1,50)\nThe initial diabetes meal plan should be based on the individual's normal intake with respect to calories, food choices, and times of meals eaten.\nChoose an insulin regimen that is compatible with their normal pattern of meals, sleep, and physical activity.\nSynchronize insulin with meal times based on the action time of the insulin(s) used.\nAssess blood glucose levels prior to meals and snacks and at bedtime and adjust the insulin doses as needed based on intake.\nMonitor A1C, weight, lipids, blood pressure, and other clinical parameters, modifying the initial meal plan as necessary to meet goals.\nIt is also important to educate those with diabetes on adjustment of prandial insulin considering premeal glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, and anticipated physical activity.",
        "It is also important to educate those with diabetes on adjustment of prandial insulin considering premeal glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, and anticipated physical activity.\nFor those with diabetes who are overweight and on insulin, counseling on nutrition, weight management, and monitoring blood glucose continues to be important components of treatment.\nMedical nutrition therapy is recommended with continued emphasis on making lifestyle changes to achieve a weight loss of 5% or more to reduce the risk of chronic complications associated with diabetes, CVD, and other risk factors that contribute to early mortality.",
        "CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS",
        "The goals of nutrition therapy for children and adolescents with diabetes include the following:\nProvide individualized nutrition therapy with guidance on appropriate energy and nutrient intake to ensure optimal growth and development.\nAssess and consider changes in food preferences over time and incorporate changes into recommendations.\nPromote healthy lifestyle habits while considering and preserving social, cultural, and physiological well-being.\nAchieve and maintain the best possible glycemic control.\nAchieve and maintain appropriate body weight and promote regular physical activity.\nEmphasis should initially be on establishing supportive rapport with the child and family with simple instructions. Nutritional advice needs to be given to all caregivers; babysitters, and extended family who care for the child.",
        "Nutrition guidelines should be based on dietary history of the family and child's meal pattern and habits prior to the diagnosis of diabetes and focus on nutritional recommendations for reducing risk of associated complications and cardiovascular risk that are applicable to the entire family.",
        "Dietary recommendations for children and adolescents with diabetes can be illustrated using the Plate Method. Various resources and educational materials are available, some specifically designed for diabetes. According to this method, half of the plate should be filled with vegetables and fruits, while the other half is split between whole grains and lean proteins.\nDairy is represented by a serving of nonfat or 1% milk, or another low-fat dairy option.\nThe macronutrient guidelines for children and adolescents generally align with those recommended for adults with diabetes.",
        "Prevention of hypoglycemia\n\nAvoid skipping or delaying meals and snacks. If using insulin or sulfonylureas, maintain consistent meal and snack timing and portions.\nMonitor blood glucose levels regularly.\nTake medication carefully and as prescribed by the healthcare provider.\nAdjust medication or have extra snacks if physical activity increases, based on blood glucose levels and the type and duration of the activity.\nHave a meal or snack if drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol on an empty stomach can lead to hypoglycemia.\nKeep track of low blood glucose events to help the healthcare team identify patterns and find ways to prevent them.\nCarry diabetes identification, such as a medical bracelet or wallet card, so others are aware in case of an emergency.\n\nPhysical activity",
        "Physical activity is beneficial for glycemic control in people with diabetes. Engaging in regular exercise improves cardiovascular fitness, weight management, and psychological well-being. The benefits of physical activity can be assessed based on its duration, intensity, modality, and frequency.\nThe primary risks associated with physical activity for people with diabetes are linked to activity intensity. Low-intensity activities are safer and still highly beneficial.\nPeople with diabetes are encouraged to engage in at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day, with walking being a recommended modality. Evidence suggests that walking after meals, particularly within two hours, is especially beneficial for glycemic control, as it helps the muscles use glucose from the bloodstream.\nHigh-intensity physical activity should be discussed with the diabetes care team due to potential risks like hypoglycemia and cardiovascular strain.",
        "High-intensity physical activity should be discussed with the diabetes care team due to potential risks like hypoglycemia and cardiovascular strain.\nIn individuals taking insulin, blood glucose monitoring is essential to adjust insulin dosing and carbohydrate intake to prevent hypoglycemia during physical activity. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, it may be necessary to adjust insulin doses before higher intensity physical activity begins.\nFor unplanned physical activity, it's important to check blood glucose levels first. If blood glucose is below 100 mg/dL, a carbohydrate snack (15-30g) should be consumed, and glucose should be rechecked after 30 to 60 minutes. If the glucose level is under 70 mg/dL, the activity should be postponed.",
        "Based on blood glucose levels at the start of the activity, as well as the intensity and duration of exercise, additional snacks may be required before, during, or after exercise. Moderate-intensity physical activity may significantly increase glucose uptake, potentially requiring an extra 15 grams of carbohydrate for every 30-60 minutes of exercise beyond the usual routine.\nPhysical activity can also increase the rate at which insulin is absorbed into the limbs, particularly if exercise follows an insulin injection immediately. To minimize this effect, insulin should be injected into a less active area, like the abdomen.\nGuidelines for managing blood glucose during exercise exist for people with type 1 diabetes. The response to physical activity can vary widely between individuals, so medication and food adjustments should be tailored to personal responses. Monitoring blood glucose is crucial for understanding how the body reacts and for customizing a physical activity plan.",
        "Current evidence suggests that low and very low energy diets, particularly those using total or partial diet replacement formula products, are highly effective for weight loss and the reduction of other cardiometabolic risk factors when compared to food-based weight-loss diets.\nAdditionally, low-energy nutritionally complete formula diets, especially those that include a total diet replacement induction phase, have been shown to be the most effective dietary approach for achieving improvements in type 2 diabetes management.",
        "Long-term, low-intensity structured programs, which include support for changing food choices, eating patterns, physical activity, and psychological support for behavior change, can be highly effective in sustaining new behaviors.\nThese programs help individuals form healthier relationships with food and improve adherence to dietary advice, ultimately contributing to successful weight-loss maintenance.",
        "Mediterranean-Style \n\nThe Mediterranean-style eating pattern has been shown to improve glycemic control and reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors. This eating pattern includes:\nVegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, potatoes, whole grains, breads, herbs, spices, fish, seafood, and extra virgin olive oil, with a focus on minimally processed, seasonal, and locally grown foods.\nOlive oil as the primary fat, replacing other fats and oils, such as butter and margarine.\nFresh fruit as a daily dessert, with sweets consumed only rarely.\nLow-to-moderate amounts of cheese and yogurt.\nRed meat limited to 12 oz to 16 oz per month.",
        "DASH Eating Plan\nThe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan is a flexible and balanced diet, based on research sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The DASH diet emphasizes:\nVegetables, fruits, fat-free or low-fat dairy, whole grains, nuts, and legumes.\nLimiting intake of total and saturated fats, cholesterol, red and processed meats, sweets, and added sugars, including sugar-sweetened beverages.\nResearch from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that the DASH diet leads to reductions in glycemia, blood pressure, body weight, and cholesterol concentrations.\nProspective cohort studies have shown that the DASH diet is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke. Additionally, DASH is significantly lower in sodium compared to the typical American diet.",
        "Intermittent Fasting\nIntermittent fasting has gained popularity as a potential strategy for weight loss and better control of type 2 diabetes. There are various forms of intermittent fasting, some involving eating only on specific days, or fasting for set hours each day, with eating periods alternating between restricted and normal intake.\nWhile no single intermittent fasting method has been definitively proven to be the best, the principle of energy restriction during fasting periods can lead to weight loss over time if there is an overall energy deficit.\nFor individuals with diabetes interested in intermittent fasting, current guidance suggests that time-restricted eating or shortening the eating window is adaptable to most eating patterns and is generally safe for adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.",
        "However, medication use must be considered, especially for those on insulin or other anti-hyperglycemic medications, as fasting can lead to hypoglycemia, which could become severe if medication doses are not adjusted. Careful blood glucose monitoring and potential medication adjustments are essential.\nOverall, intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating may offer practical strategies for those with diabetes seeking easier ways to manage their eating patterns.",
        "Gluten Free\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. A gluten-free diet is essential for people with celiac disease, an inflammatory condition where gluten causes damage to the small intestine. It is observed that around 10% of individuals with type 1 diabetes also have celiac disease, which is much higher than the general population (1-2%).\nHowever, there appears to be no link between celiac disease and type 2 diabetes. For those without celiac disease, there is no evidence to suggest that avoiding gluten offers any health benefits.\nRecently, the gluten-free diet has gained popularity among people who identify as gluten-sensitive but do not have celiac disease. The ADA states that individuals with type 1 diabetes can follow a gluten-free diet if they choose to, though it may present additional challenges.",
        "Common carbohydrate-containing foods that are naturally gluten-free include white and sweet potatoes, brown and wild rice, corn, buckwheat, soy, quinoa, sorghum, and legumes. These can serve as alternatives to gluten-containing grains."
